                <p>ZOA, the Greek word for animals, is an ongoing project that I started when I was young and keep iterating. It began as an interest in caring for endagered animals, so I used to draw, paint, and create other crafts focusing on animals and wanted to start a t-shirt company to raise awareness and money. Once I began my college career at NYU, I was introduced to the NYU MakerSpace where I learned how to laser cut, mill, and more. I loved working with these machines, so I decided to incorporate my childhood passion project and make prototypes of items with a focus on endagered animals. <br><br>
                My inspiration for these designs were based off Quibe, who is a French artist that designs with using only one line. I wanted my own style, so I also designed with one line, but made my art geometric. <br><br>
                My projects feature simple, geometric designs of endangered animals using physical materials to promote education and endangerment prevention.</p>

            <p><b>ZOA Bear Laser Cut Home Decor</b><br><br>
            The first project in this series was of a bear. I used an Epilog Laser Cutter to cut acrylic. To create the digital portion of the design, I used Adobe Illustrator. I have made this item in different sizes with multiple colors of acrylic and types of wood. A larger cut, which is roughly two feet wide, takes about 40 minutes to cut because of the intricate lines.</p>

            <p><b>ZOA Bear Necklace</b><br><br>
            I've always been very interested in making jewelry, so after making a few pieces using the Bantam Tools Othermill, I decided that I should turn my ZOA Bear design into a necklace! I used an upcycled PCB board, which is normally used to make a circut board, and milled out my design. It took about 12 minutes to cut out. After cleanining it up, I added the chain.</p>

            <p><b>Next Steps</b><br><br>
            I am working on many more designs for 18 new animals and planning to finish those up soon. Since we can't sell items created in the NYU MakerSpace, I will sell the designs as stickers, t-shirts, tote bags, and more, and ultimately gain access to a laser cutter or Othermill in the future. I want ZOA to become a non-profit so all proceeds can go to helping endangered species while promoting awareness. After building it up, I would like to add more more designs that help different social causes.</p>
