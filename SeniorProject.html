                <p>This podcast about the creative process of the <i>Watchmen</i> TV series gave me great insight into Damon Lindelof, executive producer and writer, and his team’s work to turn the comic book into a show. I learned how much research was put into creating a piece that could be understood by anyone, even if they never read the comics. <br><br>

The experience definitely resonated with my creative process, especially how he consulted people to get their input if they understood without reading the comic. I want my work to be easily understood, and still have a deeper meaning. A connection was to read more. I keep hearing the recommendation everywhere to read more, and I’ve started reading more articles and listening to podcasts, but I still struggle with reading proper, lengthy books. An epiphany I had was origin stories. It’s nurture vs. nature - you're not born this way, you're made this way. I’ve always noticed this but never really found the right words to describe it, but this is very true, especially in today’s society. People are growing every day since we are exposed to so many other perspectives and experiences through social media. <br><br>

Three inputs I got for my senior project were taking risks, how ideas are made, and easter eggs. I definitely agree with how Lindelof said that taking risks and being scared is part of the process, but you need ambition and fearlessness. Prototyping is the majority of the time spent creating, so it’s important to try new things and take risks. Lindelof’s perspective about how ideas aren’t just made in the shower is super accurate. I’ve had some pretty good ideas while in the shower, but most of my ideas have been from reading or seeing something then getting inspiration from them and developing them more through research and prototyping, and of course thinking about them in the shower too. Lastly, easter eggs are always fun to find. I didn’t even think to add easter eggs to my senior project, but I really want to try to incorporate some into my work!<br><br></p></left>
