                <left><p><b>02.07.21 Weekly Recap</b></p>
                <p>This week I finalized my idea and am going to move forward with the mycelium idea. I will be using a mycelium substrate to mold abstract pots in the form of bodies, and in those pots, grow fungi and possibly other edible plants such as herbs. To make the molds, I will be 3D modeling shapes, 3D printing them out, and using a vacuum former to create the mold. <br><br>

I did a lot of research and got a list of materials I'm going to need. After doing some budgeting, I realized that if I only grow fungi in the pots, it's going to get very pricey, very fast. This led me to consider other plants to grow too. I definitely want to keep it to growing edible plants rather than just succulents or flowers and frame it as more of a grow your own food with a close-to-zero-waste package. <br><br>

I plan to get my mycelium substrate from <a href="https://grow.bio/collections/shop/products/grow-it-yourself-material" target="_blank">Ecovative</a> and the fungi from <a href="https://smallhold.myshopify.com/collections/mushroom-grow-kits" target="_blank">Smallhold</a>, who sell grow-your-own-kits. I spoke to someone at Smallhold to see if it was okay to slice the blocks, since my pots will most likely be much smaller, and they said it was okay, but might not have a huge yield of fungi compared to leaving it at its original size. This has led me to either cut the blocks after I’m seeing large growth or just build bigger pots. As for the other edible plants, I will go to farmers markets and other local shops for herbs.

                <p>My initial thoughts while reading this article were about my actual website. I didn't realize, but I was using epicenter design when I created my Senior Design page. By using the “let’s build the frame then drop the content in” model, I made areas for Process, Research, and Responses, as well as an area for the title (when I finalize it and can replace “Senior Project” with it), my elevator pitch, and more of an about section.<br><br> 

The epicenter of my project is intertwining nature and positivity. By using mycelium for the pots, it becomes the epicenter, but once the fungi starts growing inside of the pots, it will become the epicenter. This leads to growth also playing a role in the epicenter of my story.<br><br>

As I do more research and sketches, I am building on the epicenter. My frame holds the concept of a pot and something growing inside, but the different type of fungi/plant (content) will change with each design. <br><br></p></left>

            <left><p><a href="https://www.hbo.com/video/watchmen/seasons/season-1/episodes/03/videos/podcast-ep-1" target="_blank"><b><i>Watchmen</i> Podcast Response</b></a></p>
                <p>This podcast about the creative process of the <i>Watchmen</i> TV series gave me great insight into Damon Lindelof, executive producer and writer, and his team’s work to turn the comic book into a show. I learned how much research was put into creating a piece that could be understood by anyone, even if they never read the comics. <br><br>

The experience definitely resonated with my creative process, especially how he consulted people to get their input if they understood without reading the comic. I want my work to be easily understood, and still have a deeper meaning. A connection was to read more. I keep hearing the recommendation everywhere to read more, and I’ve started reading more articles and listening to podcasts, but I still struggle with reading proper, lengthy books. An epiphany I had was origin stories. It’s nurture vs. nature - you're not born this way, you're made this way. I’ve always noticed this but never really found the right words to describe it, but this is very true, especially in today’s society. People are growing every day since we are exposed to so many other perspectives and experiences through social media. <br><br>

Three inputs I got for my senior project were taking risks, how ideas are made, and easter eggs. I definitely agree with how Lindelof said that taking risks and being scared is part of the process, but you need ambition and fearlessness. Prototyping is the majority of the time spent creating, so it’s important to try new things and take risks. Lindelof’s perspective about how ideas aren’t just made in the shower is super accurate. I’ve had some pretty good ideas while in the shower, but most of my ideas have been from reading or seeing something then getting inspiration from them and developing them more through research and prototyping, and of course thinking about them in the shower too. Lastly, easter eggs are always fun to find. I didn’t even think to add easter eggs to my senior project, but I really want to try to incorporate some into my work!<br><br></p></left>
