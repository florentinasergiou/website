                <left><p><b>02.28.21 Weekly Recap</b></p>
                <p>The mushrooms are here! I was supposed to receive the Blue Oyster Kit first and the Lion’s Mane Kit next month, but both arrived at the same time. I have decided to name them Bubbles (Blue Oyster) and Simba (Lion’s Mane). The blocks are a lot bigger than the pictures, and there’s an inconsistency of what part of the block the mushrooms will grow out of, so designing the pot shapes has had a few changes. Once I start to see where the growth spots are, that will help guide me in better designs. <br><br>

My outside critic accepted and it will be Omar Gowayed, Co-founder of the NYU Urban Food Lab. He has experience with mycology, so I am looking forward to getting some great advice about best caring for my mushrooms and using the mycelium substrate. <br><br>

I was looking at different things created with the mycelium substrate and found “tiles” that had carved designs. If I have to keep the block this big, then I am leaning towards making a rectangular pot to fit the block and carve designs on the outside. I still plan to make at least one or two abstract pots and will put the final flush of mushrooms in them, so it won’t ruin the block from creating more. </p></left><br><br>

                <left><p><b>02.21.21 Weekly Recap</b></p>
                <p>My mycelium substrate arrived! I didn’t realize that the packages have to be refrigerated once received, so they currently take up a fourth of my fridge. They have an expiration date of 10 weeks, so that means I need to finish molding them by May 1st. That is definitely enough time for prototyping and finished models, but it does still give me some motivation to get molding as soon as I’m ready. <br><br>

I started some 3D modeling. The first design is a head where the mushrooms will grow out of the <i>brain</i>. I also made some sketches of hands holding the mushrooms, as well as abstract bodies and shapes. I feel that I’m going to have to use bigger pots which can’t be vacuum formed, so I will most likely have to laser cut some cardboard and wrap the insides with plastic wrap to create larger molds to grow the mycelium and then carve away the excess to get curved shapes. <br><br>

Still deciding on a name. Got some good feedback in our accountability group meeting, so that should be finalized soon. Also got some feedback on things I should consider and shape ideas.</p></left><br><br>

                <left><p><b>02.14.21 Weekly Recap</b></p>
                <p>This week I ordered my materials! I got 2 bags of the mycelium substrate because I’m not sure how much I’ll need and didn’t want to wait 3 weeks for another pack to ship. I also ordered 2 different types of mushrooms. The first kit coming is Blue Oysters and the second kit is Lion's Mane. <br><br>

I made a <a href="https://trello.com/b/QTihlQcE" target="_blank">Trello Board</a> to keep track of my process, as well as research, such as links for how to create the Mycelium Substrate and care for the mushrooms while they're growing. After thinking about what will happen next, I looked at some recipes that could be given with each pot depending on what’s being grown in it. For example, the Blue Oyster Mushroom pot would give recipe cards for <a href="https://www.yummly.com/recipe/Oyster-Mushroom-Pizza-with-Paprika-and-Chives-9337152" target="_blank">Oyster Mushroom Pizza with Paprika and Chives</a>, <a href="https://www.yummly.com/recipe/Ricotta-and-Oyster-Mushroom-Lasagna-2570399" target="_blank">Ricotta and Oyster Mushroom Lasagna</a>, and <a href="https://www.yummly.com/recipe/Oyster-mushroom-and-hazelnut-spread-324607" target="_blank">Oyster Mushroom Hazelnut Spread</a>. <br><br>

I also did more research on similar projects and found this beautiful exhibit by Claudia Fontes, called <i>Foreigners</i>, where she created small-scale porcelain sculptures of humans with holes in them, and looked “mycelium like” because some looked as if they had spores growing out of the holes. Another project I found was <i>GROW</i>, which is a concept-project by designer Pascal Leboucq and Lucas De Man, who took over 6,000 small mycelium building blocks and stacked them to create a sculpture in the shape of a rising human. <br><br>

Lastly, I reached out to a potential outside critic, but waiting to hear back, and made my first Alpha Version of my Project Plan. </p></left><br><br>

                <left><p><b>02.07.21 Weekly Recap</b></p>
                <p>This week I finalized my idea and am going to move forward with the mycelium idea. I will be using a mycelium substrate to mold abstract pots in the form of bodies, and in those pots, grow fungi and possibly other edible plants such as herbs. To make the molds, I will be 3D modeling shapes, 3D printing them out, and using a vacuum former to create the mold. <br><br>

I did a lot of research and got a list of materials I'm going to need. After doing some budgeting, I realized that if I only grow fungi in the pots, it's going to get very pricey, very fast. This led me to consider other plants to grow too. I definitely want to keep it to growing edible plants rather than just succulents or flowers and frame it as more of a grow your own food with a close-to-zero-waste package. <br><br>

I plan to get my mycelium substrate from <a href="https://grow.bio/collections/shop/products/grow-it-yourself-material" target="_blank">Ecovative</a> and the fungi from <a href="https://smallhold.myshopify.com/collections/mushroom-grow-kits" target="_blank">Smallhold</a>, who sell grow-your-own-kits. I spoke to someone at Smallhold to see if it was okay to slice the blocks, since my pots will most likely be much smaller, and they said it was okay, but might not have a huge yield of fungi compared to leaving it at its original size. This has led me to either cut the blocks after I’m seeing large growth or just build bigger pots. As for the other edible plants, I will go to farmers markets and other local shops for herbs.

                <p>Research is one of, if not, the most important steps in any project. Steven Pressfield does a great job in explaining the importance of it and how it fills the gaps. This has been shown in every project I have done, especially my senior project so far. I filled in all my worries and gaps by just doing more research. Pressfield’s mention of the process was very eye opening. “It progresses in two stages: action and reflection. Act, reflect. Act, reflect.” I never realized it, but this is exactly what happens. And when I did try to act and reflect at the same time, it always ended badly, which is something he pointed out. After reading this, I realized I need to narrow down and keep refining my understanding of my theme because it is not at a Gold Version just yet.</p></left>

                <p>My initial thoughts while reading this article were about my actual website. I didn't realize, but I was using epicenter design when I created my Senior Design page. By using the “let’s build the frame then drop the content in” model, I made areas for Process, Research, and Responses, as well as an area for the title (when I finalize it and can replace “Senior Project” with it), my elevator pitch, and more of an about section.<br><br> 

The epicenter of my project is intertwining nature and positivity. By using mycelium for the pots, it becomes the epicenter, but once the fungi starts growing inside of the pots, it will become the epicenter. This leads to growth also playing a role in the epicenter of my story.<br><br>

As I do more research and sketches, I am building on the epicenter. My frame holds the concept of a pot and something growing inside, but the different type of fungi/plant (content) will change with each design. <br><br></p></left>

            <left><p><a href="https://www.hbo.com/video/watchmen/seasons/season-1/episodes/03/videos/podcast-ep-1" target="_blank"><b><i>Watchmen</i> Podcast Response</b></a></p>
                <p>This podcast about the creative process of the <i>Watchmen</i> TV series gave me great insight into Damon Lindelof, executive producer and writer, and his team’s work to turn the comic book into a show. I learned how much research was put into creating a piece that could be understood by anyone, even if they never read the comics. <br><br>

The experience definitely resonated with my creative process, especially how he consulted people to get their input if they understood without reading the comic. I want my work to be easily understood, and still have a deeper meaning. A connection was to read more. I keep hearing the recommendation everywhere to read more, and I’ve started reading more articles and listening to podcasts, but I still struggle with reading proper, lengthy books. An epiphany I had was origin stories. It’s nurture vs. nature - you're not born this way, you're made this way. I’ve always noticed this but never really found the right words to describe it, but this is very true, especially in today’s society. People are growing every day since we are exposed to so many other perspectives and experiences through social media. <br><br>

Three inputs I got for my senior project were taking risks, how ideas are made, and easter eggs. I definitely agree with how Lindelof said that taking risks and being scared is part of the process, but you need ambition and fearlessness. Prototyping is the majority of the time spent creating, so it’s important to try new things and take risks. Lindelof’s perspective about how ideas aren’t just made in the shower is super accurate. I’ve had some pretty good ideas while in the shower, but most of my ideas have been from reading or seeing something then getting inspiration from them and developing them more through research and prototyping, and of course thinking about them in the shower too. Lastly, easter eggs are always fun to find. I didn’t even think to add easter eggs to my senior project, but I really want to try to incorporate some into my work!<br><br></p></left>
