                <p>By sending the message to 'bloom through the crumbles' and creating these designs, my goal was to spread positivity. Despite any evil eyes that are on you or if you feel like you're crumbling, you will always bloom.<br><br>
                I first designed it using Adobe Photoshop, then used a risograph printer to print the colors layer by layer.</p>

            <p><b>Adobe Photoshop</b><br><br>
            The first piece of this series was designed using Adobe Photoshop. I drew the background pattern of evil eyes and added paint splatter. For the statue, I manipulated a painting to be textured, carved out the top of the head, and added a crumbled look to tthe bottom. I then added an image of sunflowers to bloom out of the head. Lastly, I added the text of <i>Bloom Through the Crumbles</i>.</p>

            <p><b>Printed using a Risograph</b><br><br>
            When my design was ready, I set up the file to be formatted for the risograph printer. I printed out each color layer by layer.</p>

            <p><b>Remix</b><br><br>
           I decided to mess around and remix the design, so I chose to make it in only two colors - blue and pink. I also moved and reformatted the text.</p>
