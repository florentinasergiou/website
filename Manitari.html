<img src="ManitariProcess.jpg" width="100%" alt="This is Manitari, a Senior Project in Digital Media, in the IDM NYU department, by Florentina Sergiou. The full process is at florentina.org/SeniorProject. There are blue evil eyes for decoration on the edges.
                                                               
This is Manitari (μανιτάρι), which means mushroom in Greek-Cypriot. Blooming through nature, culture, and mindset by growing mushrooms in a pot that tells stories through design, manitari creates an interactive portal to the Cypriot culture. I grew mushrooms and designed pots to hold them based on ancient Cypriot pottery. Some designs include evil eyes, olive branches, waves, an octopus, and cultural crossroads that linked networking to Egypt, Syria, and the other Mediterranean regions.  All of these symbols share stories to the  Cypriot culture. I also created a recipe card for Koupes, a Cypriot dish, that incorporates the mushrooms. Overall, I want to intertwine nature with positivity to create an interactive portal to the Cypriot culture.
                                                               
The concept originally started with using mushrooms in a way to promote positivity, but after speaking with my mentor, Omar Gowayed, he recommended that I focus on the Cypriot aspect. This led me to do more research on ancient Cypriot pottery designs. After my research, I started sketching and drew nine that I wanted to try out. After doing some prototyping, I decided to go with five designs: evil eyes, octopus, olive branches, ancient crossroads, and waves. When my designs were ready, I laser cut tiles of the designs to see how each pattern would come out. 
                                                               
I decided that the evil eye pattern came out best, so I designed the pot to have that pattern. The design also includes a bendable cover in case of transport (or to use when your mushrooms have stopped growing), as well as removable panels since the mushroom growth locations are random.

While designing, I was growing my mushrooms. There are pictures of the mushrooms as buttons after week 1 and full waves after week 2.5.  

After harvesting Bubbles, I tried a few different recipes. I then remembered my favorite Cypriot dish, Koupes, and made a recipe card for that.

Thank you and Kali Orexi (enjoy your meal)!">
